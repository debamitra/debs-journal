### Math, Math everywhere...
I decided to start my journey into learning math from scratch. What does this look like? Well, I need a plan, but it shouldnt be too much of a plan as I dont want things to be too rigid or unyielding.

I came across [this guide by Susan Rigetti](https://www.susanrigetti.com/math) on Hacker News about studying math. It talks about the basics or pre-requisites/High school math : Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Trigonometry and Geometry before going on to suggesting a full curriculum.

Once I cover the pre-requisites, I probably will pick up AI-specific math like Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, Statistics, Probability and Calculus.

I am a little lost of how to structure this, there doesnt seem to be any one thing I could just follow along like a book or a roadmap. Or maybe there is and I need to find it.

Khan Academy seems to have changed its website a lot since I saw it last. I cant find topics etc like there used to be. 


### Something concrete..
I checked out the *teachyourselfcs* guide to Math for CS, it seems very perfunctory. OSSU has a more detailed guide, maybe will start with this -

### Next Steps..
Alright, thats it for today. No more overthinking, lets get into it from tomorrow!
