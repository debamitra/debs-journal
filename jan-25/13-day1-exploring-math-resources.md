I spent about 40 mins today doing the [Pre-Algebra Assessment](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/test/xb4832e56:course-challenge) on KhanAcademy. 

https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites - This is the plan I am following for basics.

Other resources to check out - Mathematics, a human endeavor, a Book by Harold Jacobs (suggested by a friend)

Lets Review all the basics first then. 

Also, remember to use pen and paper and work out the problems instead of trying to do them in your head

From OSSU, going to go through the OpenStax textbook for PreAlgebra tomorrow.
