### What I did today..

I spent about 40 mins today doing the [Pre-Algebra Assessment](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/test/xb4832e56:course-challenge) on KhanAcademy. 

A few things, I didnt know and got wrong (not exhaustive)

1. **Inequalities** This problem below,

2. **Constant of proportionality** - In a proportional relationship, the ratio between two variables (y and x) is constant. This constant is called the constant of proportionality, often denoted by k as such : y = k.x



### Plan I am following for basics.. 

https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites 

Other resources to check out - Mathematics, a human endeavor, a Book by Harold Jacobs (suggested by a friend)

Lets Review all the basics first then. 

Also, remember to use pen and paper and work out the problems instead of trying to do them in your head

From OSSU, going to go through the OpenStax textbook for PreAlgebra tomorrow.
