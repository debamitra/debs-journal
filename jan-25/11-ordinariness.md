### Ordinariness

When I was a kid, I dreamed of having friends, cousins, a big family, and loved ones to share my life with. I longed for connection and adventure and imagined the joy of being surrounded by people who cared about me and we went on exciting quests together - camping, hiking, trekking, travelling in a caravan, picnics, to the sea etc etc. Later, I wanted to spend all my time watching movies and TV shows, immersing myself in those pretend worlds that seemed so magical and perfect.

But now, as a 36-year-old adult, my perspective has changed. I think big families suck. They seem to always be entangled in endless competition, politics, and negativity. Corporate life sucks too. It’s a game where you’re expected to work for other's convieniences and wealth, constantly trying to prove your worth, otherwise being discarded like garbage. Socializing feels just as draining. The surface level conversations, the status games, the constant expectations all feel like more effort than it’s worth.

I just want to be an ordinary person, one among the crowd, free to do my own things, live however I like. I don’t want the noise, the politics, or the drama. I just want to learn, create, explore, and grow. To live a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling to me.

I have realized that freedom is what matters most to me. Freedom to choose how I spend my time. Freedom to think, to grow, and to just exist without pressure or expectation. That’s what fulfillment looks like for me, living authentically and finding joy in the little things.

No more chasing the noise. Here, it can only be calm and quiet.
