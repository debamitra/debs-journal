#### I started reading about Operating Systems..

Going through OS:Three Easy Pieces which is a free online book. 

I learned about what is a process today, how processes are created in Unix, process states, what are system calls( it's an interface  between your app and the OS which can talk to the hardware and do stuff like read/write files on disk etc). 

I learned that a process is basically a running program. So a process is just some memory that's reserved and the program instructions are loaded into that memory and then read by the cpu and executed one by one...so what happens when a process runs  is that data and instructions are manipulated or moved around between processor, memory and i/o. But also , the OS doesn't run programs linearly but schedules them and also keeps  switching between them to give the illusion of "concurrency". 

I am very excited, want to build a simple os..I read the first 2 chaps today, will continue tomorrow and also work on the exercises.
