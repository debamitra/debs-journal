# Notes on My Ongoing Learning Journey

### A Shift in Focus

I have never been very strategic or intentional with my career. Nevertheless, my resume shows a steady progression through tech roles over the past 10+ years from software engineer to senior engineer and eventually lead, gradually picking up experience, both technically and personally.

But now, at 36, I want to slowly move away from targeting external measures of success and focus inward. In the last few years, I have spent more time working on myself, not just external blockers, but more the internal ones. It's been a long process, learning to reframe how I think, to build confidence, and to be more deliberate in how I approach things. It’s a journey with no end date, and I still keep working at it.

### The Impact of Continuous Learning

Continuous and sustained learning has transformed my life in some very subtle but impactful ways, bringing me greater confidence, personal satisfaction, fulfillment, stability, peace, and a touch more joy.

For a very long time, I wanted to dive back into studying CS fundamentals from scratch, following a roadmap like [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), and I wanted to revisit the basics, build my foundational knowledge.This year, I finally started.

I picked the topic "Computer Architecture" first, with the book *Nand2Tetris Part 1*. It took me well over 3 months to finish 5 chapters, but the challenge felt just right, like the Goldilocks story. It wasn’t too easy that I got bored, nor difficult enough to discourage me. It provided the perfect balance, pushing me just enough to stay engaged without becoming too overwhelming. I rediscovered an old source of childhood joy, pouring over programming books and solving problems.

I started studying every day. Even when I was exhausted after work, I put in a little bit of time because it brought me joy and comfort. That's the word I have been looking for, *comfort*. These little moments of time I spent studying felt like being wrapped in a warm quilt on a cold evening, with a soft comforting light shining on me. It engaged my mind and I felt at ease. Coupled with a steady sense of accomplishment and delight, it felt real and grounding.

### Expanding to New Topics

Halfway through the year, I picked up the next topic — “Operating Systems”. I started reading *OSTEP* and explored the *xv6 OS* in parallel along with it. I am almost finished with the last few chapters now. At one point, I had to pause for work, and getting back into it was tough because the break had gone on for so long that my initial interest had faded, but I eventually returned to it again.

Next, I am planning to explore a little bit of math and AI. I’m not sure how that’s going to go — I have always found math a bit difficult and boring, and AI, being so math-heavy, feels like more of the same. It’s beyond my usual areas of interest, but I am hoping that gaining more confidence from learning the basics, will lead me to find new interesting things to dive into in the future.

### Some Concluding Thoughts

When I first started on this journey, I didn’t know how things would pan out, but I took small steps anyway (with some help) — being kind to myself, reframing negative thoughts, and building habits over time. 

After a few years of very non-linear progress and often even some regression, I have noticed some changes. I was being kinder to myself naturally, I don’t often feel as anxious anymore, and it became easier for me to pull myself out of negative thoughts and return to positivity. I was more in control. It’s slightly easier for me to even sometimes override procrastination and do something small. I feel a little successful with this and hope to hold on to it going forward.
