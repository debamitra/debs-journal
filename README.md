## About

This journal is a collection of my thoughts, notes, and reflections as I explore computer science, programming, and whatever else catches my attention. It’s where I try to make sense of what I am learning, keep track of my progress, and maybe even find some clarity along the way.

Thanks for dropping by. Feel free to follow along as I dive into new ideas, experiment with concepts, and see where this journey leads.
