## About

This journal is a stream of my thoughts, notes, and reflections as I wander through computer science, programming, and the occasional tangent. It’s a place to make sense of what I am learning, keep track of my own growth, and maybe even find some direction along the way.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to follow along as I dig into new ideas, play around with concepts, and just see where this journey takes me.
