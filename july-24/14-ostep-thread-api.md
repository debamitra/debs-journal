#### Reading Chapter 26 today .. The Thread API
Finished the questions in chapter 25 and read Chapter 26. It starts with talking about the interface exposed as per POSIX for thread creation and thread management

NOTE - need to look up Function pointers.

- **Thread creation** - pthread_create()
- **Thread completion** - pthread_join()
- **locks** - pthread_mutex_lock(), pthread_mutex_unlock()
- **condition variables** - pthread_cond_wait(), pthread_cond_signal()



#### The virtual memory exercise - The road so far!
Nien! Today I read novels and slept, tomorrow is another day when I look forward to attempting this again.


#### Writing the Blog post? How do thy fare?
