### Study..

Read the remaining portion of Threads API chapter. Read about Locks  (for running only one thread in critical section) and Conditional Variables to wait and signal between threads

Played a fun gamified version of concurrency concepts [here](https://deadlockempire.github.io/) . Done upto Locks

Going to take a stab at the questions for this Chapter tomorrow. 


### Work..
Another internal project to get started with from tomorrow. I need to figure out and plan for what I want to learn from it. I obviously asked chatGPT and it told me to focus on improving leadership skills, strategic thinking and innovation. Hmm..
