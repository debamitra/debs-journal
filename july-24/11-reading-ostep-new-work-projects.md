#### Interviews
Interviewed a pretty knowledgable candidate today. Enjoyed it. I need to list down some system design questions and rotate through them, for every candidate so that my own design interview skills also improve. Need to curate some links i will refer to, to create my list. 

Some resources I'll go through when I am free -
- [Roadmap for System Design](https://roadmap.sh/system-design)
- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- [Videos on System Design](https://www.youtube.com/@SystemDesignInterview)

#### OSTEP
Going to read OSTEP chapter 25, sharing my thoughts here in a while.

#### Work

Wrapping up one project and starting with the Project Proposal for another.
Need to understand the existing system, architecture, current drawbacks etc. Then start with scoping activities.
