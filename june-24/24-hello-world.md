I started the day with reading about GNU philosopy and a little bit about how the gdb works. 

I found an interesting read [here](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/stallman-kth.html) where Richard Stallman discusses hacker culture and his thoughts on it. He also talks about his ideas for writing a debugger, the features it would have and how it would work.

After that, I did some work calls for my two projects.

Its about lunch time now, and I am not very hungry. I am thinking about what tasks I should work on or what I should learn today.  I think I will work on the memory exercise that Ramana and I decided on last Saturday but didn't get around to because we spent time setting up the remote debugging environment locally. 

There is that xv6 playlist to go through [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWUJKH0RNFE&list=PLbtzT1TYeoMhTPzyTZboW_j7TPAnjv9XB) as well. I am at video 4 right now. 

So, to summarize :
##### To learn
- [x] xv6 kernel playlist
- [ ] memory exercise from ostep

##### To work
- [x] calls
- [ ] calls
- [ ] plan
