A rational expression is simply a fraction of polynomials. where denominator is not equal to zero

The part about rational expressions that confuses me is the forbideen values things. And how we come upon it.

What is the use of learning rational expressions. New do we use fractional polynomials? 

Its hard to solve rational inequalities. Need to find the intervals of the solution too.
