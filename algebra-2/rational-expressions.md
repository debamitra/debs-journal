A rational expression is simply a fraction of polynomials. where denominator is not equal to zero

The part about rational expressions that confuses me is the forbbiden values things. And how we come upon it.

What is the use of learning rational expressions. How do we use fractional polynomials? 

Its hard to solve rational inequalities. Need to find the intervals of the solution . 

##### Checklist for Rational inequalities

1. Make RHS as 0
2. Reduce
3. Find critial points -> 0 of the numerator, 0 of the deominator
4. plot critial points in graph
5. pick test value in each internal
6. answer the enequality
